Cons: We were able to hear the people in the room next to us as if they were in our room. We were in room 1018 and the room with the noise was 1016. The woman woke up at 6:00 am and was speaking on her phone using the speaker phone. She was speaking in an abnormally loud voice, but not so loud that we should have been able to hear her. I've rarely had such an issue with speaking noise room-to-room at a hotel and would not expect this issue at a Marriott.

I also did not like that I could not self-park my car in the garage. There is another garage nearby but we arrived late at night and I could not tell how long the walk would be. We had to pay a premium for valet parking. I would have preferred to park my car myself."

David Prez front desk mgr. denied me a bottle water he stated that I pay $3.00. Since, I refused he directed me to there nearest water container.

Cons: A disappointing stay at what seems to be a poorly run, uncaring Marriott. Even before arriving, my question about a shuttle from the airport was unanswered.


Upon arrival, trying to get free wifi was an ordeal. To avoid being charged, I was forced to join the Marriot Club, Bonvoy, which took 3 people and half an hour due to connection problems. Not what I needed at 11:00pm.


The hotel could easily provide a courtesy shuttle to/from the mall, saving customers a sweaty 10-minute walk, like it used to - but no, that would be too civilized.


Yesterday, my wife and I wanted to enjoy sitting in the lounge. We were the only ones there. We requested for the channel to be switched from a Spanish infomercial channel to show some Wimbledon coverage. The concierge smiled sweetly and said that changing the channel was impossible. One would receive better service in a dive bar.


I now understand the reason why the rating for this hotel, which has very good facilities, modern bathrooms, large TVs and comfortable beds, has dropped to a meager rating of Good."

Cons: Apesar de ter pagado por dois dias (28 e 29) e de ter feito o check in somente no dia 29, por volta de 08hs, não houve serviço de quarto neste dia e quando voltamos do passeio o quarto estava desarrumado. Além disso, faltaram toalhas e tapete de banheiro em quantidade suficiente, pois precisamos usar as que havia no banheiro para conter a água que escorria do box, de
modo a evitar que inundasse todo o banheiro e o quarto, pois se tratava de
uma acomodação adaptada para cadeirantes e não havia qualquer contenção da água que escorria do box. Justamente por tais incômodos a representante do hotel me garantiu que seria contada apenas uma diária e que faria o estorno do quantia referente à segunda diária para que eu pudesse solicitar o reembolso junto a Boooking. Assim, aproveitando o contato, venho requerer o reembolso da segunda diária que paguei a Booking, pois o hotel já fez o estorno da quantia."

En ese momento nos dijeron que no había ningún problema, que ellos resolvían el tema con la manager.
Fuimos a corroborar ese tema, y la manager Paula Temponi insistió con argumentos contradictorios y de una manera petulante que era nuestro error e igualmente no estaba habilitado el desayuno para los 4, que era lo que estaba escrito en la reserva.
Finalmente permitieron el desayuno de solo 3 personas, mi marido no pudo hacerlo con la familia."
